## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Git repository (or repo) after you successfully created a Github account.
<!-- VS Code provides a powerful environment for coding and development across various programming languages. -->

**Some basic jargon before we start:**
In Git or GitHub jargon,

- A **repository** or *repo* is a collection of files where your work is stored.
- A saved change is called a ``commit`` in Git and GitHub.
- [**Git**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a command line software that handles your *repos* and its version control.
- **GitHub** is a web interface that helps with your *repos* and faciliates collarations with version control.
- **GitHub** uses **Git** to do everything with *repos*.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. An internet connection.
2. Completed Git installation and version-check.
3. Completed a Github account creation.

## Steps to create a GitHub repo

### 1. Login to your GitHub account, locate and click on the ``New`` button
- Click on ``New`` button!

### 2. Create a new repository

2.1 Enter a repository name.

2.2 Choose to write a brief description (optional).

2.3 Leave the check-box for "Add a README file" empty. Note: In this example we will create a README in the subsequent steps.

2.4 Click on ``Create repository``.

### 3. Create a README file

3.1 First, save some important information for future needs

- Click on the ``HTTPS`` tab, copy the url of your repo and save it a separate document.
- Copy the git-command lines and save them in a separate document.

3.2 Next, click on the ``README`` link to start creating a README file

- Note: README files are very important for github repos, especially in a collaboration between users.

### 4. Review the ``README.md`` file that was initiated in Step-3

- ``README.md`` file can be edited using *Markdown* language. The ``md`` file extension loosely stands for "Markdown".
- Learn more about *Markdown* [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [here](https://www.markdownguide.org)
- *Markdown* is a very simple [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) to create a structure and format for documents. Older and similar languages are [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) and [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).

### 5. Edit the ``README.md`` file that was initiated in Step-3

5.1 Edit the ``README.md`` as shown in the image below. 
- Note: The typed text there is in *Markdown* format.

5.2 Once done with editing, click on ``Commit changes...`` button. 
- Note: Github requires files to be committed once changes are made.

### 6. Type a ``Commit message`` and ``Commit changes``

- In Git and GitHub, it is very uesful to type up a ``Commit message`` that briefly describes the changes or the saved file. 
- Click on ``Commit changes`` once done and the ``Commit message`` will be associated with saved or committed file.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a new repository or *repo* on Git or GitHub. Your *repo* is now ready for you to use for collecting your committed files and collaborate with your peer group.
