    <td width="70%">
      
      Prof. Kartik V. Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. 
      
      He designed taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      
      His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.  
      
      He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee and William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.

    <td width="70%">
      
      I am Vishnu Gajula, a dedicated engineering professional currently pursuing my second master's degree in Industrial/Engineering Management at The George Washington University. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering, followed by a Master of Technology in Manufacturing Systems from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in Hyderabad, India.

      Throughout my career, I've gained valuable industry experience through roles at JSW Steel USA as an Industrial Mechanical Engineer and JSW Cements as a Cement Production Logistics Intern, where I developed expertise in project coordination, design optimization, and process improvement. My technical skills include 3D modeling, prototyping, CNC machining, and various engineering software tools. Currently, as a Graduate Assistant at The George Washington University, I am expanding my capabilities by combining technical expertise with management skills, preparing myself for future leadership roles in the engineering industry.
