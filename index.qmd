### Course description
The Internet of Things (IoT) is perceived as a collection of smart, connected devices with the ability to send and receive data; “internet” encapsulates connectivity and “things” are devices (electronic or mechanical) that can be adapted toward connectivity. 

There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.  

This course explores these aspects of IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. Students will be exposed to the IoT framework using a variety of sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in **$\mu$-labs** (micro-labs) that incorporate the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language. 

The students will learn about how IoT with edge computing capability is going to be the backbone of the Industry 4.0.
