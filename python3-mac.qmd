# Installing Python on macOS

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Python on macOS, configuring the user-specific Python bin path, and exporting it in your `~/.zshrc` file for easy access.

## Step 1: Download and Install Python

1. Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
2. Download the latest version of Python for macOS by clicking on the "**Download Python X.Y.Z**" button (replace **X.Y.Z** with the latest version).
3. Open the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "**Add Python X.Y to PATH**."

## Step 2: Verify Python Installation

To ensure that Python is installed correctly, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python3 --version
```
## Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook
To install Jupyter Notebook, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip3 install jupyter
```
This command will download and install Jupyter Notebook, a powerful tool for interactive Python development.

## Step 4: Export Python Bin Path in `~/.zshrc`
Now, you will export the Python bin path in your `~/.zshrc` file to make it accessible in your terminal sessions. To open `~/.zshrc` for editing, follow these simplified steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Type the following command and press Enter:
```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```
This command will open your `~/.zshrc` file in the default text editor.

3. In the text editor, add the following line at the end of the file:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin
```
4. Save the file and close the text editor.

## Step 5: Create `~/.zshrc` if Not Found
If you receive an error indicating that the `~/.zshrc` file does not exist, you can create it using the following command:

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
```
This command will create an empty `~/.zshrc` file if it doesn't already exist.

Now repeat **Step 4**.

## Step 6: Apply Changes
To apply the changes, either restart your terminal or run the following command:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
Your Python installation is now set up and configured for use on macOS.

## Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook
To start Jupyter Notebook, open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, allowing you to create and run Python notebooks for interactive coding and data analysis.


## Conclusion
You have successfully installed Python and Jupyter Notebook on your macOS system, configured the user-specific Python bin path, and exported it to your `~/.zshrc` file for easy access. You can now use Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and data analysis.

Happy coding!
