**READ ME before you start installations on your personal computer:**

- The course is desinged with active learning modules with limited number of hardware components. It is required that these software be installed and working on your computers so that you may connect to the hardware provided and execute programs effectively. 

- You are strongly encouraged to bring your own personal machine or laptop and participate with the [prerequisites](install-editor.qmd) installed.

- **Only Windows 10+ or Macintosh 12+ computers with QWERTY keyboards are supported for this course.** The instructor has limited time to troubleshoot any OS-related problems.
  - The QWERTY (pronounced KWEHR-tee) keyboard is the standard typewriter and computer keyboard in countries that use a Latin-based alphabet.

- **Linux OS-based laptops / personal computers and mobile /handheld-devices are not supported this semester for in-class usage on your personal machine.**

- **Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspberry Pi OS will be in all devices for IoT applications developed during the course.**
  - Raspberry Pi OS is a Unix-like operating system based on the Debian Linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi family of compact single-board computers. Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_OS)

# Additional information on remote access software: VNC&reg; Viewer

VNC&reg; Viewer is a remote access software application, that facilitates exchange data over the RFB protocol to allow the Viewer to control the Server's screen remotely.

Source: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealVNC)

<!-- <small>*Running your First Program*</small> -->

 - **How do I install VNC&reg; Viewer?**

Just run the installer on the device you want to control from and follow the instructions, or there’s MSIs for remote deployment under Windows. If you don’t have permission to install VNC® Viewer on desktop platforms, choose the standalone option.

- **How do I control a remote computer?**

If you have a keyboard and mouse in front of you, use them as you would normally. We don't recommed the use of a mobile device for this workshop. However, if you’re on a mobile device, then your touchscreen acts as a mouse trackpad, with gestures mapped to mouse buttons.

- **Do I need to license the software?**
No. VNC &reg; Viewer is always free to use. Just accept the EULA the first time you run.

<!-- ## *What is an Editor?*

In the world of programming, an editor is more than just a text processor. It's your creative workspace where you bring your code to life. Here are some key aspects of code editors:

- **Text Editing**: At its core, an editor allows you to write, edit, and organize code in various programming languages. It provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code completion to enhance your coding experience.

- **Code Execution**: Some editors, like Jupyter Notebook, not only allow you to write code but also execute it in an interactive and step-by-step manner. This is especially useful for data analysis and experimentation.

- **Extensions and Plugins**: Code editors are highly customizable. You can enhance their functionality by installing extensions or plugins tailored to your needs. For example, you can add Python-specific tools or themes to make your editor visually appealing.

- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Some editors, such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code), go beyond text editing and offer a complete integrated development environment with debugging capabilities, version control integration, and more.

- **Collaboration**: Many editors support collaborative coding, allowing multiple programmers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, which is crucial for group projects.

<!-- In your CSCI1010 class, you'll use a combination of Anaconda, Jupyter, and VS Code:

- **Anaconda**: Anaconda is a Python distribution that simplifies package management and environment setup. It's particularly valuable for data science projects, as it comes with a wide array of pre-installed libraries and tools.

- **Jupyter**: Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment that enables you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's an excellent choice for data analysis and presenting your findings.

- **VS Code**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile code editor that supports multiple programming languages and offers a rich ecosystem of extensions. Its user-friendly interface and powerful features make it a great choice for general programming tasks. -->
