## Objectives
We will now have you <em>type</em>, </em>run</em>, and save your first <em>computer program</em>.

::: {.callout-note}
- Programs are <em>typed</em> in using your computer's keyboard, just as you would type in an email or text document. 
- And just as the "thing you are typing into" is different for email and for text-editing, there is a different "thing" to type programs into.
- The <em>typing</em> is one part of getting a program. If you just type your program, it will just be sitting there on your computer. But you want to go the next step and <em>run</em> (or, execute, as we say) the program. Typing and not-running is loosely analogous to typing an email but not <em>sending</em> it (the email will just remain in composed-form, but go nowhere). Similarly, typing text into Word doesn't mean it gets "published".
- The "thing" into which you type and run your program is called a <em>code editor</em> or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, a mouthful).
- We are going to give you the option of using one of two code editors, <em>Thonny</em> or <em>Spyder</em>. Think of them as apps that help you type and run programs.
