## 2.0 An example with function calls
Consider the following program:
```python
# define a function we'll use later
def print_big_M():    
    print('*   *')
    print('** **')
    print('* * *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')

# define another one we'll use later
def print_big_O():    
    print('*****')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*****')

# Print MOO using the above defined functions
print_big_M()
print_big_O()
print_big_O()
```    

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.1

Type up the above in `animal_sounds.py`and run it. Also save the file so that it can be submitted (You will need to save the appropriate files for everysuch "type up" exercise).
:::

Let's point out a few things:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module2/animalsounds.png)

- Let's start by distinguishing between a function <em>definition</em> (which uses `def` and merely tells Python what the function is about), and invocation (which asks Python to execute the function at that moment).
    - A <em>function definition</em> is a piece of code that begins with the word `def`
    - A function definition is sometimes also called <em>function declaration</em>.
    - A function definition does not execute the code immediately.
    - Instead it's like saving in one place a bunch of instructions that can be invoked with just the name of the function.
    - This saves writing lots of code if a group of code can begiven a name (in this case, a function name).

- A function definition has 5 elements:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module2/funcdef.png)

- A function with a given name is defined just once.
- A function invocation merely uses the name, along with parentheses:

    ```python
    print_big_M()
    ```
We'll later see examples where some things can go between the parens.

- While a particular function is defined once, it can be used any number of times:
    - In fact, that is the whole purpose of defining functions.
    - Each use of a function is a single line of code, which saves us the trouble of rewriting all the code that was inside the function for each time we need it.

- Function definitions also help isolate code so that one doesn't have to see or understand what's inside to use it.

- We've already used such a function before: the `print` function.
    - The `print`function is defined internal to Python.
    - We don't type its definition, nor do we see it.
    - We just use it as often as we like.

- **Important:** Please pay careful attention to <em>indentation</em>
    - The line that begins with `def` should NOT be indented.
    - Other lines that belong to the function <em>should</em> be indented.
    - There are other forms of indentation that we'll point out as we proceed - they're all <em>important</em>.

### Exercise 2.3

Write your own animal sound that uses one function at least thrice with an exclamation mark at the end, <em>e.g.</em> print the big version of `BAAA!`. Write your code in `my_pet_sound.py`. Once your program is working, say the sound out aloud to celebrate. (Why not?)
:::

Next, let's see how functions "work" by making a small change to the program:
```python
def print_big_M():
    print('*   *')
    print('** **')
    print('* * *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')

def print_big_O():
    print('*****')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*****')

print('Step 1')
print_big_M()
print('Step 8')
print_big_O()
print('Step x')
print_big_O()
print('Step y')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.4

Type up the above in `animal_sounds2.py` and run it.
:::

Let's explain using an analogy:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module2/funcexecution.png)
  
- We'll use the analogy of a <em>house</em> to describe a program and its parts (the functions).
- A program's <em>execution starts at the very top</em>.
- In the above case, there are a number of definitions:
     - Definitions are merely "processed" but not executed.
     - It's understood that the definitions may be invoked later.
     - In our house analogy, we walk past these "rooms" to the main lobby.
   
- The first real line of code is the `print('Step 1')`statement.
    - Think of this section of code as the "main lobby".

- After this, we see the line (also a command) `print_big_M()`
    - This is an instruction that causes the computer to "go to the `print_big_M()`room".
    - We then head to that room and start executing commands in there.

- Thus, the third command that gets executed is `print('*   *')`
 
-  We're still in the room with more commands to go, and the next one (4th so far) is `print('** **')`

- Continuing, we execute the last line in the room, which will make this the 7th one executed.

- After we leave the "room", <em>and this is important</em>, we continue execution after the invocation that brought us to the room.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.5

At which step (which step number) do we execute the last line in `print_big_O`? And then, at which step do we enter `print_big_O` the second time and print its first line? In `animal_sounds3.py` replace x and y with the correct step number. Use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to describe your answer.

###### **2.6 Video**
{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module2/u0-mod2.6.mp4 aspect-ratio='21x9' >}}

## 2.1 Calling functions from other functions
Consider this program:
```python
def print_big_M():
    print('*   *')
    print('** **')
    print('* * *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *\n')

def print_big_O():
    print('*****')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*****\n')

def print_two_big_Os():
    print_big_O()
    print_big_O()

print_big_M()
print_two_big_Os()
```
- Yes, we can write our functions that call our own functions.
- Incidentally, did you notice the escape sequences?
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &rArr; We improved the output.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.7

Use this idea to rewrite your own animal sound in a file called `my_pet_sound2.py`. That is, add an additional function to your earlier program `my_pet_sound.py` that is analogous to `print_two_big_Os()` above.
:::


- Once again, let's trace through some steps:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module2/funcexecution2.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.8

Look at the example above. What step number is represented by the question mark (?) next to the second `print_big_O()` inside the `print_two_big_Os()` function? What line in the program represents step 15? Discuss the program to correctly identify “step-15” with your TAs. There is nothing to submit in this exercise.
:::

###### **2.9 Video**
{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module2/u0-mod2.9.mp4 aspect-ratio='21x9' >}}

- Mental execution:
- We will use the term <em>mental execution</em> for the above exercise of tracing through the execution without actually compiling and running the program.

:::{.callout-note}
Mental execution is <em>extremely important</em> in developing programming skill <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rArr; Please be sure to practice this with <em>every</em> program you read or write.
:::

- We can't emphasisize this enough. Really.
- Remember:
     - Execution starts at the top of a program and goes downwards.
     - Function definitions are <em>processed</em> (understood) but not executed.
     - When a function are <em>invoked</em>, execution "goes" into the function to execute the code in there.

## 2.2 More about functions
About function names:

- Consider the function name `print_big_M`.
- This is a name we chose.
- We could just as easily have called it `my_crazy_function`:

    ```python
    def my_crazy_function():
        print('*   *')
        print('** **')
        print('* * *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *\n')

    def print_big_O():
        print('*****')
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*****\n')

    def print_two_big_Os():
        print_big_O()
        print_big_O()

    # Use the different name:
    my_crazy_function()    
    print_two_big_Os()
    ```

- In other words, the compiler does not look into the <em>English meaning</em> of function names.
- We choose function names to help us <em>read</em> programs.

Beware of name clashes:

- Consider the following program (that has a mistake):

    ```python
    def print_big_M():
        print('*   *')
        print('** **')
        print('* * *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *\n')

    def print_big_M():      # A mistake! We meant to have typed
        print('*****')      # print_big_O()
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*   *')
        print('*****\n')

    # What happens now?
    print_big_M()
    ```

- In this example, we have functions with different content but with the same name.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.10

Implement the above in `name_clash.py` along with the comments (text followed by '#' symbol) in it and run it. Submit your program. Discuss the program with your TA to understand the comments  in the program.
:::

- What we see is that the second definition replaces the first.
- The program runs but this error is not identified as such by the language. Instead, we need to be careful not to unintentionally make such a mistake.

The order of function invocation matters. For example, consider:
```python
def print_big_M():
    print('*   *')
    print('** **')
    print('* * *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *\n')

def print_big_O():
    print('*****')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*****\n')

def print_two_big_Os():
    print_big_O()
    print_big_O()

# We've changed the order here:
print_two_big_Os()
print_big_M()
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.11

Type up the above example in `animal_sounds4.py` and run it to make sure there are no errors.
:::

## 2.3 A peek at the future
Once again, we will present a small program with features yet to be explained, by way of getting you comfortable and yet curious.

Here's the program:
```python
import tkinter as tk
import random as rand

window = tk.Tk()
w = 500
h = 400
canvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=w, height=h)
canvas.pack()

# A function that draws a random circle
def draw_random_circle(color):
    x = rand.randint(0, w)
    y = rand.randint(0, h)
    size = rand.randint(0, w/10)
    canvas.create_oval(x,y, x+size, y+size, fill=color)

# draw 100 circles
for i in range(100):
    draw_random_circle("cyan")

# Standard colors: "black", "red", "green", "blue", 
# "cyan", "yellow", "magenta"

window.mainloop()
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.12

Type up the above program in `random_art.py` and execute it. When you quit your program, instead of x-ing out the window, use control-c ("control" key and "c" key pressed together) while the cursor is in the output window.
:::

Now let's point out a few features:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module2/randomart.png)

<!-- :::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.13

Use the same code in `random_art2.py` and then add and modify it to create your own art, and include a screenshot in `module2.pdf`. When you quit your program, instead of x-ing out the window, type  `control-c` ("control" key and "c" key pressed together) while the cursor is in the output window.
::: -->

About <em>control-c</em>

- The standard keyboard has some keys that act together with other keys, in effect <em>modifying</em> them.
- The <em>shift</em> key is the most obvious one: pressing the shift key along with another key either capitalizes a letter or types the symbol "above" in a two-symbol key. For example, the ampersand &amp; is "above" 7 on the same key as 7; thus, pressing shift and 7 achieves typing &amp;
- On a Mac, you've probably used the <em>command</em> key, and on Windows, you've used <em>control</em>.
- The <em>control</em> key, when used with other keys is often used in programming contexts.
- One such case is to use <em>control-c</em> (control and c together) to terminate the execution of a program.
- However, to do this, you first need to click into wherever the program is executing. This is typically the output window (where the output appears).

## 2.4 And now for something strange

Consider the following program:
```python
def print_big_M():   
    print('*   *')
    print('** **')
    print('* * *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *\n')

def print_big_O():   
    print('*****')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*   *')
    print('*****\n')
    print_big_O()    # We're invoking the function from within

print_big_M()
print_big_O()
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.15

_Before doing this exercise_, please [**read this page**](../guides/stopping.qmd) on how to  stop endlessly running programs. Now, type up and execute the above program in `my_strange_example.py`.
:::

:::{.callout-tip title="Hint"}
You might get a “recursion depth exceed” error. Ask your TA about what this error means. 
:::

The term <em>recursion</em> is used when function calls itself:
    - In the above example, it's an obvious error
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &rArr; Nothing useful is accomplished.

- Later, we'll learn to use recursion to solve problems.

- In fact, <em>recursion</em> is one of the most powerful computational problem-solving paradigms.

## 2.5 Another reminder about computerese
How is your computerese coming along? Are you now much more confident with folders, files, zip files and such? What about editing, and saving?

Don't forget that you can always review the [**material on computerese**](../guides/computerese.qmd) from Module 0.

Please check that your module2 folder has the right files before you zip and upload. Does it look like one of these sample screenshots:
