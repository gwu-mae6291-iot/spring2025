## 1.0 comments
A <em>comment</em> is like a note-to-self that you include directly in a program as a way to explain something to yourself for later, or to someone else who reads your program.

```python
# This is a comment
      # This is one too, but not recommended 

print('Something')      # And so is this
```
Let's explain:

- A comment begins with a `#` and ends at the end of the line.
- Anything written as a comment is not treated by your computer as a "command" or as programming intent.
- Thus, as far as programming goes, the above program is as good as:
```python
print('Something')
```
- You can insert comments in various places in a program:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module1/comments.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.1

Under your `unit0`, create a `module1` folder (if you haven't already), and then write up the above in `my_comments.py`. Fix the second comment to start at the beginning of the line, and add an entirely new comment line of your own.
:::

Sometimes one needs a comment to spill over multiple lines, as in
```python
# I wrote this program at midnight
20 seconds before the deadline
print('Something') 
```
Notice the missing # in the second line of the comment.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.2

Write up the above in `comment_error.py`. Remember to save the file (and do this for every exercise in the future that involves a program). 
:::

## 1.1 Whitespace
Consider the following program:
```python
print   (  'Hello World!'     ) 
```
Notice the spaces inserted in various places.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false} 
### Exercise 1.3

Write up the above in `whitespace_example.py` and submit.
:::

Consider this variation
```python
  print('Hello World!')
```
(Two spaces before `print`).

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.4

Write up the above in `whitespace_example2.py`. Run and check if you are getting any errors.
:::

Finally, look at:
```python
print('Hello     World!') 
```
(Extra spaces between Hello and World.)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.5

Write up the above program in `whitespace_example3.py`,  by including 5 empty spaces between `Hello` and `World`. Run and check if you are getting any errors.
:::

Let's point out a few things:

- Some kinds of whitespace, even if ill-advised, is permitted.
- When starting a line of code, proper indentation is expected, which is why we got an error when we indented the line starting with `print`
- The extra spaces between Hello and World are perfectly acceptable if the goal is to print them. Printing accepts whatever spaces you want printed.

## 1.2 Strings
A <em>string</em> in Python is a sequence of letters, digits, or symbols (like $ or *) surrounded by either

- A pair of double quotes, as in: `"Hello World!"`
- A pair of single quotes as in: `'Hello World!'`

:::{.callout-note}
- Whichever quote you use to start a string must be used to end the string.
- The ending quote must be on the same line as the starting quote.
- There are special techniques to handle long strings that need to spill over multiple lines (which we'll see below).
- This raises some questions:
    - Is it possible to print a single line but with multiple print statements?
    - How does one print a quote?
:::

First, note that we can use single or double quotes for different strings in the same program:
```python
print('Hello')
print("World!") 
```
:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.6

Confirm that Hello and World! get printed on two lines by writing the above in `my_string_example.py`
:::

A print statement prints the string within parenthesis and then goes to the next line of output, which is why we see World! on the next line.

To keep printing on the same line:
```python
print('Hello', end=' ')
print('World!')
```

:::{.callout-note}
We've reverted to using single-quotes for all strings, which will be our preference.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.7

Confirm by writing the above in `my_string_example2.py`.
:::

We'll now go the other way and have a single string itself contain a directive to spill over to the next line.
```python
print('Hello\nWorld!') 
```
Notice the backslash `\` followed by `n` inside the string: `'Hello\nWorld!'`

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.8

Write up the above `my_string_example3.py`. Run and check if you are getting any errors.
:::

Strings can embed special so-called <em>escape sequences</em> that begin with backslash.

This will give us one way to print a quote:
```python
print('My friend\'s friend\'s dog\'s friend')
```

Another way is to use one set of quotes to delimit the string that are different from the ones used within:
```python
print('My friend\'s friend\'s dog\'s friend')
print("bit my friend's dog's ankle")
print('who yelped "owww"')
```

How does one print a backslash itself? By using a double backslash:
```python
print('The backslash character, \\, is less intimidating now')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.9

Write a program called `practice_escaping.py` that prints out

```python
  "    "   \\\
  "    "    \    
  """"""    \    
  "    "    \    
  "    "   \\\  
```
:::

###### **1.10 Video**
{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module1/u0-mod1.10.mp4 aspect-ratio='21x9' >}}

Another use of backslash: to make long strings

- Sometimes we need to type in a really long string.
- The following does NOT work:
```python
print('An Ogden Nash poem:')
print('The camel has a single hump; 
The dromedary, two; 
Or else the other way around. 
I’m never sure. Are you?')
```
<a id="exercise-1.11">

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.11

Write up a program called `my_string_example4.py` with the above program and run it. Submit the program. Observe the error the program generates to assess for yourself why the program returns the error.
:::

</a>

To spread a single string over multiple lines, one uses a <em>triple quote</em> as in:
```python
print('An Ogden Nash poem:')
print('''The camel has a single hump; 
The dromedary, two; 
Or else the other way around. 
I’m never sure. Are you?''')
```
:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.12

Write up a program called `my_string_example5.py` with the 5-line limerick above program and run it. Observe that error the program doesn't not generate an error. Submit the program. Compare this program with [**Exercise 1.11**](./module1.qmd#exercise-1.11) to assess why there is no error in this program. You can discuss this program with your TA if you haven't figured it out for yourself.
:::

Empty strings:
- It is possible to not have anything in a string, as in:
```python
print('')
```

:::{.callout-note}
There are no letters, digits or anything between the two single quotes above.
:::
- Such a string is called an <em>empty string</em>.
- Odd as it may seem, empty strings are useful (we'll see later) when you want to add strings to make a longer string.



## 1.3 Case sensitivity
What if we had used uppercase P instead of lowercase p in print?
```python
print('Hello World!')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.13

Write up the above program `case_error.py` using uppercase P instead of lowercase p, in print and run it. Use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to describe the error in the python-file.
:::

What if we changed the case inside a string?
```python
print('helLo WoRLd!')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.14

Write up the above program in `my_string_example6.py` and run it to see if it works.
:::

Python is case sensitive but strings are like <em>data</em> inside programs, which means they can be whatever we like.

- The two strings `'Hello World!'` and `'helLo WoRLd!'` are fine as two different strings, if that's we want.
- However, Python has only one  `print` and so it won't recognize `Print` (with capital P).




## 1.4 A peek at the future
We will occasionally jump ahead and present an example of a program that does something advanced, just so you get a feel for what's coming.

With these examples, we'll only ask you to type up the program and run the program.

And then we'll point out a few features, just so that you get acquainted with features that you'll eventually encounter.
``` python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
canvas = tk.Canvas(master=window, width=500, height=400)
canvas.pack()

for i in range(1, 10):
    fontSize = i * 20
    fontStr = 'Times ' + str(fontSize) + ' italic bold'
    startx = 200 + 10 * i
    starty = 20 + i * 20
    canvas.create_text(
        startx, starty, text="Hello", font=fontStr, fill='grey')

window.mainloop()
```
:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.15

Write up the above program in `hello_gui.py` being careful to type it in exactly as shown above, paying attention to every keystroke. Run it to get something like: ![](../../../media/units/unit0/module1/hello-gui.png) If something went wrong with the typing, you can instead download <a href="../../../media/units/unit0/module1/hello_gui.py" download>**hello_gui.py**</a> but only after giving the typing a good try. When you quit your program, instead of x-ing out the window, use control-c ("control" key and "c" key pressed together) while the cursor is in the output window.
:::

Now let's point out a few features of the program, and we'll focus on the middle section:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module1/for-loop.png)

Our belief is that by showing you bits and pieces of advanced code, you'll be primed to absorb these concepts when we work through them.

One of the most important things to observe about is that some code is <em>indented</em>:

## 1.5 A reminder about computerese
As you complete Module 1 and ready that for submission you might want to review:

- Did you make your `module1` folder? Did you ensure that the `m` in `module1` is lowercase and that there's no space `module` and `1`?
- Are your Python programs from this module in that folder?
- Do you recall how to make a zip?

If it's a bit hazy, please make sure to review from the [**material on computerese**](../guides/computerese.qmd) from Module 0.
