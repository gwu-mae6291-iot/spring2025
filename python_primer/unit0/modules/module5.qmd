## 5.0 Strings
About strings:

- We have already seen examples of strings, as in:
  ```python
  print('Hello')
  ```

- Here, whatever is in between the quotes is treated as <em>one thing</em>: a sequence of letters, digits or symbols.
- Here are examples with digits, symbols and spaces:
  ```python
  print("Hello there. I'm on my way to 123 Main Street")
  print("#@%&! I'm late!")
  ```
- The entire sequence of letters, digits, punctuation etc from the `H` in `Hello` to the `t` in `Street` is one string.
- And you already know that "#@%&!" translates to "Drat!"

Just like integer values can be placed in variables, we can do the same with strings:

- Example:
  ```python
  s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
  print(s)
  ```
Here, the variable `s` has the string `'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'`

- If you're wondering how a variable (we used a box as an analogy) can fit so many letters, that is a somewhat advanced topic.
- For now, let's proceed with the notion that we can do this.

Consider this example:
```python
# Make a string and print it:
s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
print(s)

# Extract the length of the string and print that:
k = len(s)
print(k)
```

- Here, we are using a function called `len` to extract the length of a string.
- The function `len` is like `print` in one respect: there is something that goes in between the parentheses:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module5/str_example.png)
- But it is different in another respect: something comes out of the function and gets placed into the variable `k`
- We will later look further into how we can write our own functions that have this property of "making something and giving the result" to a variable.

### Exercise 5.1

Type up the above in `my_string_example.py` and submit it. You should look at the printed output that are string and its length. Count the characters to figure if it is accurate. Note that empty spaces are also characters.
:::

## 5.1 String concatenation
Strings would be of limited use if there were no way of combining them, just as integers would be if there were no way of performing arithmetic.

The joining of two strings end to end is called <em>concatenation</em>.

Consider this program:
```python
x = 'The'
y = 'quick'
z = 'brown'

s = x + y + z
print(s)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Exercise 5.2

Type up the above in `my_string_example2.py` and submit. You should look at the printed output that are string and notice that the there are no empty spaces in the output-string.
:::

About concatenation:

- The same `+` that we used for integer addition is what's used to concatenate strings.
- Thus <em>multiple-usage</em> of symbols in a programming language is common: we'll see other examples of a single symbol or function serving multiple purposes.
    - How come Python doesn't get confused and think that x, y, z are integers wanting to be added?
    - Python is smart about context, and understands that when `+` is used with strings, the only reasonable thing to do is to concatenate. Likewise, with numbers, Python will add them.
- You may have noticed the words all strung together without a
  space. So let's add the spaces:
  ```python
  x = 'Sphinx'
  y = 'of'
  z = 'black'

  s = x + ' ' + y + ' ' + z + ' quartz, judge my vow'
  print(s)

  print(len(s))
  ```
- Notice how multiple strings, some from variables, and some just written into the statement, are concatenated:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module5/str_example2.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.3

Type up the above in `my_string_example3.py` and submit it. You should look at the printed output and observe how many times the concatenation occur. 
:::

We also introduced something new:
```python
print(len(s))
```
Here's how to read this line:

- First look at `print` and notice that there's something between the parentheses:
  ```python
  print(len(s))
  ```
- Think to yourself: something is going to be given to `print` to get printed.
- Now look at what's going to `print`:
  ```python
  print(len(s))
  ```
- Here we see that the length of the string `s` is being computed.
- What you should be thinking is:
    - The length will <em>first</em> get computed.
    - And <em>then</em> the result (36, in this case) will be sent to `print`.
    - `print` then prints it to the output, which is what we see.
- One way to think about this is to use a term, <em>nesting</em>, that we've seen before:
    - Here, the function invocation to `len` is nested in the function invocation to `print`
    - The innermost in this case executes first.
- In case you were wondering: yes, one can nest deeply with one function invocation inside another, inside another etc. But we won't need that anytime soon.

Often we want to concatenate strings with numbers, or other kinds of things:

For example: consider
```python
k = 26
s = str(k)
t = 'A pangram must have all ' + s + ' letters'
print(t)
```
- Here, the value in `k` is an integer.
- Prior to concatenation with a string, we first need to make a string out of the integer:
  ```python
  s = str(k)
  ```
- We do this by sending the integer `k` to the `str` function, which builds a string version of the integer and gives that back.
- The string so computed is then placed into the variable `s` above.
- This string  `s` gets concatenated with the other strings to produce the final result.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.4

Type up the above in `my_string_example4.py` to confirm that prior to concatenation with a string, all variables being concatenated are cast as strings. Submit the program.
:::

Let's examine a small variation:
```python
k = 26
# You can also build a string in the print statement itself:
print('A pangram must have all ' + str(k) + ' letters')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.5

Type up the above in `my_string_example5.py` to see if the small variation in the earlier program results in an output. Submit your program.

## 5.2 Fun with string concatenation
We will occasionally introduce programs we've written to both simplify your programming and yet allow for interesting examples.

If all we did was compute with integers, it would be boring.

You've already seen one example of such a tool: `drawtool`.

We'll now use `wordtool`, another tool that you will use by calling appropriate functions.

You are welcome and are encouraged to "look inside" by skimming over the code in any tool.

Let's look at an example that will also introduce some new ideas:
```python
import wordtool

# Invoke functions in wordtool to pick random words:
adj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()
noun = wordtool.get_random_noun()
noun2 = wordtool.get_random_noun()
verb = wordtool.get_random_verb()
prep = wordtool.get_random_preposition()

# Build a sentence with these random words:
sentence = (
    'The ' + adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' + verb + 's' +
    ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2 + '.')
print(sentence)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.7

Type up the above in `my_random_sentence.py`. Don't run it just yet. First download <a href="../../../media/useful/wordtool.py" download >**wordtool.py**</a> and <a href="../../../media/useful/wordsWithPOS.txt" download >**wordsWithPOS.txt**</a> into the same folder as your program. Now run the program several times. You should observe that every time you run the program a new sentence is genreated. Submit your program.
:::

Let's point out:

- `wordtool.py` is merely another Python program, like the ones you've been writing, just a bit more complex.
- `wordsWithPOS.txt` is plain text data (about English words, and parts-of-speech).
- `wordtool.py` is written to read the data and make some functionality available, one of which is to randomly pick words from amongst the nouns, adjectives, and so on.
- To use functions in `wordtool.py` in your program, you need (and this is a new thing we've introduced) the `import` statement at the top of your program:
  ```python
  import wordtool
  ```
:::{.callout-tip}
The .py part is not in the import statement
:::

- Then, to use a function defined in that other file, we use syntax like this:
  ```python
  adj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()
  ```
<ul>
- Here, `adj` is a string variable that we made. 
- The combination of  `wordtool`, a period, and the desired function `get_random_adjective()`, is what's needed to invoke that particular function.
- In this case, it results in a randomly selected adjective (from the thousands in the data) being copied into the `adj` variable.
</ul>
- Similarly, after getting a random noun, verb, and so on, we put those together to make a sentence. Hopefully, with hilarious results.
- We'll point out one other new thing:
  ```python
  sentence = (
      'The ' + adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' + verb + 's' +
      ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2)
  ```
<ul>
- Here, we are concatenating many strings into a long one.
- However, if it's unwieldy to type them all in one line, we can spill over into multiple lines.
- One way to do that is to use parentheses as shown above.
</ul>

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.8

Open `wordtool.py` and examine the functions within. Use `wordtool.py` and follow the earlier program, `my_random_sentence.py` to create a program, `my_random_sentence2.py` that generates a longer random sentence. Since you are writing this in the same folder, you won't need to download `wordtool.py` and its data, `wordsWithPOS.txt` again. Submit `my_random_sentence2.py`.

## 5.3 Input from the terminal
Thus far we have printed (output) to the screen but have not taken in any input.

Thus, we haven't written any programs that interact with potential users of our programs.

There's a limited market for programs that only execute once with no input whatsoever, right?

So, let's do something more interesting by asking the user to type in a string:
```python
import wordtool

# We will get the user to type their name:
name = input('Enter your name: ')

# We'll use that and make rudimentary conversation:
print('Hi ' + name + '!')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.10

Try writing the above program in `my_random_conversation.py`. Since you are writing this in the same folder, you won't need to download `wordtool.py` and its data, `wordsWithPOS.txt` again. Submit your program.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
- The function `input` is exactly what it sounds like: get input (from the user typing).
  ```python
  name = input('Enter your name: ')
  ```
- Here, there's a string that goes into the `input` function. This string is displayed as a prompt in the output:
  ```python
  Enter your name: 
  ```
- Of course, you aren't writing this tiny program to send to someone who will run your program and type in their name. You are playing both roles: programmer and intended user.
- Whatever the user types in (from the keyboard) becomes a single string that's placed in the variable we've called `name`
- Then, we've concatenated whatever gets into `name`with two other strings and printed the result:
  ```python
  print('Hi ' + name + '!')
  ```
:::

Next, let's make it more interesting:
```python
import wordtool

name = input('Enter your name: ')

print('Hi ' + name + '!')

adv = wordtool.get_random_adverb()
adj = wordtool.get_random_adjective()
sentence = name + ', you are ' + adv + ' ' + adj + '.'
print(sentence)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.11

Improve on the above program by writing your version of a longer conversation `my_random_conversation2.py`. Allow the user to type in something  using `input()` at least two or three times. For example, your `input()` function calls can prompt the user to type in an adjectie and adverb of their choice. Additional calls of `input()` in the program will prompt the user type those in. Unleash your guile and creativity. Submit your program, `my_random_conversation2.py`
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.12

Try out a conversation with a chatbot. For example, one of the earliest chatbots in history was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>, which <a href="http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/">you can try out</a>. **There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**
:::

## 5.4 Strings and for-loops
Consider this program:
```python
n = 6
s = ''

for j in range(1, n):
    s = s + '*'

print(s)
```
:::{.callout-note}
- We can initialize the value of `s` to the empty string `''` (nothing between the quotes).
- The loop successively concatenates a string with an asterisk (`'*'`) onto the gradually accumulative string `s`.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.13
Type up the above program in `my_loop_example.py`. Then change the value of `n` to 8 and examine the output. Submit your program with `n` set to 8.

On your own, trace the execution of the loop, showing the contents of the string, `s` in each iteration of the for-loop changing values using a table in a spreadsheet or a document. The practice of tracing allows you to confirm the final output of the program, `my_loop_example.py`.
:::

Next, let's use a nested loop to output a triangle of asterisks:
```python
n = 5
s = ''

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(0, i):
        s = s + '*'
    s = s + '\n'

print('A triangle with base=' + str(n))
print(s)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.14
Type up the above program in `my_triangle.py` and submit it.

On your own, try tracing the execution of the nester-for-loop, showing the contents of the string, `s` in each iteration of the nested-for-loop changing values using a table in a spreadsheet or a document. Tracing the execution of the loop, showing the contents of the string `s` in each iteration of the outer for-loop allows you to confirm the final output of the program, `my_triangle.py`. Use the tabular tracing approach as in the <a href="../../../media/units/unit0/module3/TracingExample.pdf" download >**example from Module 3**</a>.
:::

Next, we'll make this more interactive:
```python
s = ''

n_str = input('Enter triangle base size: ')
n = int(n_str)

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(0, i):
        s = s + '*'
    s = s + '\n'

print('A triangle with base=' + str(n))
print(s)
```

###### **5.15 Video**
{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module5/u0-mod5.16.mp4 aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.16

Type up the above in `my_triangle2.py` and submit it.
:::

We've introduced some new concepts above:

- Since everything typed as input initially is made into a string, the actual input, even if it's an integer, is a string.
- This is a little strange but it's how Python works.

Consider this example:
```python
n = 42       # This is an integer
s = '42'     # This is a string

k = 5        # Integer
t = '5'      # String
```
- Thus, when the user types in what they intend to be an integer, the `input` function makes a string out of it:
  ```python
  n_str = input('Enter triangle base size: ')
  ```
Here, the variable `n_str` will have a string.

- We need to convert that string version of an integer into an actual integer using the `int` function:
  ```python
  n = int(n_str)
  ```
Here the variable `n` will have the actual integer, which we can use in loops, in arithmetic, and so on.

- Notice that, since we want the loop to run `n` times, we've begun the outer loop at 1, running through to n (inclusive).
- This means using `range(1, n+1)` in the outer loop.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.17

Trace (using a table) through what happens above when the user enters 6. You may use the tabular tracing approach as in the <a href="../../../media/units/unit0/module3/TracingExample.pdf" download >**example from Module 3**</a>.**There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.18

What happens when the conversion from string to integer is not done? Find out by trying this:
```python
n = input('Enter an integer: ')
k = 5 * n
print(k)
```
Fix the issue by converting the string that's in `n` and making an integer. Type your code in `my_conversion.py`.

{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module5/u0-mod5.20.mp4 aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

## 5.5 The useful relationship between characters and integers
Consider these three strings:
```python
x = 'hello'
y = 'h'
z = '$'
```

:::{.callout-note}
- The strings in variables `y` and `z` are fundamentally different from the one in `x` in that the strings in `y` and `z` have only one letter (or symbol) in them.
- We call such a single-letter or single-symbol string a <em>character</em>.
:::

There is a special relationship between characters and some integers:

- For example:
    - The character 'a' is sometimes represented by the integer 97.
    - The character 'b' is sometimes represented by the integer 98.
    - ... and there are other examples.
- Think of this as a "secret code" maintained by Python, with that associates a number for every letter.
- The technical term for this "secret code" is <em>Ascii code</em>.
- We often use the shorter term "char" instead of "character".
- So, every char has an Ascii code (pronounced "ass-key"). Who said computer nerds don't have a sense of humor?

Consider this program:
```python
first_letter = 'a'
last_letter = 'z'

k = ord(first_letter)
print(k)

n = ord(last_letter)
print(n)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.20

Type up the above in `my_char_example.py` and submit it.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- We've used longer, more descriptive variable names like `first_letter`.
- We'll say more about this in a separate section below.
:::

- The `ord` function takes a char and produces the corresponding Ascii code.
  ```python
  k = ord(first_letter)
  ```

Going the other way: from Ascii code to char

Consider this program:
```python
k = 97
s = chr(k)
print(s)      # Prints the char 'a'
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.21

Type up the above in `my_char_example2.py`. Try changing the value of the variable, `k` to 98, 99 and 100 in this program. Run it for each new value of `k`. Find out what the value of `k` should be to print the character, 'z' (last lowercase letter) and confirm that by running the program. 

Submit the program, `my_char_example2.py` with the the value of `k` that prints the character 'z'.
:::

The usefulness of the Ascii code:

- The value of knowing the code is that we can <em>iterate</em> over numbers and use that to iterate over letters.
- For example:
  ```python
  for i in range(97, 122):
      s = chr(i)
      print(s, end='')
  print()
  ```
- Inside a computer, it turns out all characters are actually stored as integers, and merely interpreted as characters when the occasion calls for it.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.22

Type up the above in `my_char_example3.py`. It should print the english alphabets. But notice that it may not be printing all the alphabets. What do you need do to print the complete set of english alphabets. 

Fix the program, `my_char_example3.py` to print the complete set of english alphabets and submit it.

**Hint: You need to change the stop-condition in the `range()` function.**
:::

## 5.6 Variable names
Most often, we've been using single letter <em>variable names</em>,
for example:
```python
i = 7
j = 15 * i
print(j)

x = 'Hello' 
y = 'World'
z = x + ' ' + y
print(z)
```

Let's rewrite the above with more meaningful variable names:
```python
days_in_a_week = 7
days_in_a_semester = 15 * days_in_a_week
print(days_in_a_semester)

first_greeting_word = 'Hello' 
second_greeting_word= 'World'
full_greeting = first_greeting_word + ' ' + second_greeting_word
print(full_greeting)
```

About variable names:

- First, let's review the very notion of a <em>name</em> in Python, along with other kinds of "words" that are allowed in Python programs.
- Reserved words or keywords:
  - Some words in the language belong formally to the language itself.
  - These are words like `for`, `in`, `def`, and others.
  - In fact, just to complete this, here's the full set of 33 reserved words:
  <blockquote>
    and as assert
    break
    class continue
    def del 
    elif else  except
    False finally for from
    global
    if import in is 
    lambda
    None nonlocal not
    or
    pass
    raise return
    True try
    while with
    yield
  </blockquote>
  - Everyone of these must be used in very specific ways, in statements or in more complex structures.
  - We will learn more about these as we proceed in the course.
  - We won't learn about all of them, because full mastery of the language takes more than one course.
- At the other end of the spectrum, there are words that we freely create for our use, as in these examples:
  ```python
  def print_hello():
      print('Hello')

  print_hello()

  x = 'How goes?'
  print(x)

  for i in range(1,10):
      print(i)
  ```
<ul>
- Here, we made a function and decided to call it `print_hello`
- We decided to call the string variable `x`
- And to call the loop variable `i`
- These are called <em>identifiers</em> (jargon alert).
</ul>
- Since we get to choose them, we could rewrite the above program as:
  
  ```python
  def say_greeting():
    print('Hello')

  say_greeting()

  follow_up = 'How goes?'
  print(follow_up)

  for my_loop_variable in range(1,10):
      print(my_loop_variable)
  ```
- So, what should dictate our choice of these names?
  - Generally, for numbers, loop-variables and short calculations, we prefer single-letter names like `x` and `i`.
  - Function names should carry some meaning so that anyone else who needs to use them should be able to make sense of them.
  - Sometimes, variable names should be longer when we want the code to be readable long after it's written.
  - For example, it would not make sense for Python to use `cryptic_blob_42` instead of `print`.
- The use of <em>underscores</em>:
  - You've noticed by now the presence of underscores in our variable and function names.
  - An underscore is a convenient visual aid to help us read.
  - Writing `days_in_a_week` is better than `daysinaweek` because it's easier to see.
  - **Important:** we cannot use spaces, so `days in a week` would be incorrect as a variable name.
- Generally, we shouldn't go overboard and make unnecessarily long names either, as in `the_number_of_days_in_a_week`.
- <em>Another important rule</em>: use only letters, digits and underscores, and always start with a letter. Do NOT use other symbols like % or $ in variable names.
- Finally, there are some function and variable names "already taken". That is we can't use them (or shouldn't) because Python has decided to use them.
  - For example: `print` is a function name.
  - As are `chr` and `ord` and various math functions.
  - While we could technically use these names, we should avoid the conflict because it breaks convention and can cause hard-to-find problems.

- Here is a list of "avoid" names:
<blockquote>
abs, all, any, ascii, 
bin, bool, bytearray, bytes, 
callable, chr, classmethod, compile, complex,
delattr, dict, dir, divmod,
enumerate, eval, exec, 
filter, float, format, frozenset, 
getattr, globals,
hasattr, hash, help, hex,
id, input, int, isinstance, issubclass, iter,
len, list, locals, 
map, max, memoryview, min,
next,
object, oct, open, ord,
pow, print, property,
range, repr, reversed, round,
set, setattr, slice, sorted, str, sum, super,
tuple, type, 
vars,
zip
</blockquote>
Do NOT use these as your own variable or function names.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.23

Let's see what can go wrong if we use one of the words "already taken". Consider this program:
```python
s = 'Hello'
len = 5       # This is a BAD idea
print(len)
```
We really should not be using a variable called `len` since `len` is a predefined "already taken" name. Type up the above your program in `my_variable_name3.py` and see if there is any error. Submit `my_variable_name3.py`. Don't gloat yet :)

Now, type the program below in `my_variable_name4.py`:

```python
s = 'Hello'
len = 5       # This is a BAD idea
print(len)

t = 'Some looooooong sentence'
k = len(t)
print(k)
```
The program, `my_variable_name4.py` will generate errors since we chose a variable from the list of "avoid" names.
Submit `my_variable_name4.py` even though it generates errors.

## 5.7 A problem solving example
Possibly the hardest aspect of programming is <em>problem-solving</em>:

- Typically, we're given an English description of a problem, with the goal of writing a program to solve the problem.
- The hard part is not the typing, and remembering syntactic details like parentheses.
- The hard part is figuring out what to write in code to solve the problem.

Let's work through an example problem and solve it.

Before that, we'll learn one more string function:
```python
s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
n = s.count('a')     # How many a's occur in the string s?
print(n)
```
:::{.callout-note}
- We've introduced a new feature of strings: the ability to count occurences of a letter in that string.
- Notice the unusual way by which the function must be used:

  ```python
  n = s.count('a')
  ```

  and NOT

  ```python
  n = count(s, 'a')
  ```

- That is, the function `count` appears to be part of the string variable `s`.
- This is a somewhat advanced topic, so we'll just use it and be glad we have this feature. (There are other such functions we'll avail of.)
- This is possible for any string, such as:
  ```python
  x = 'helloooooooo'
  print(x.count('o'))    # Number of o's in string x
  y = 'missisippi'
  print(y.count('i'))    # Number of i's in string y
  ```
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.25

Count the number of o-characters and i-characters in the words, 'helloooooooo' and 'missisippi'. Confirm by typing up the program above in `my_letter_count.py` and submit it.
:::

OK, now the problem:

- A <em>pangram</em> is an English sentence that contains all 26 letters.
- We've already seen two examples:
  
  ```python
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
  Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
  ```
- There's an informal competition running over a hundred years to find the shortest grammatically correct English sentence that's a pangram.
- Our smaller problem: given a sentence, print the number of a's, the number of b's ... and so on. This could be useful in judging such a competition.

Let's work towards a solution:

- Given a candidate pangram, we could count the number of a's:
  ```python
  s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
  print(s.count('a'))
  ```

- Then, we could also count the number of b's:
  ```python
  s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
  print(s.count('a'))
  print(s.count('b'))
  ```

- If we repeated this 26 times, we'd have a count for each letter.
- But the moment we see a bunch of repetition, our computational problem-solving instincts (yes, still developing) should kick in:
<blockquote>
  Repetition &rArr; use a loop!
</blockquote>
- What is the nature of iteration in this problem?
  <br> We are iterating through the letters 'a' to 'z'
- And we already know how to iterate over the letters:

  ```python
  for i in range(97, 123):
    letter = chr(i)       
    # Recall: We're going from Ascii code to letter
  ```
- Could we combine this with the counting of occurences inside the given string? So, the idea would be:
  ```python
  for i in range(97, 123):
    letter = chr(i)       
    # Now somehow use that to do the counting of occurences
  ```

- Combining:
  ```python
  s = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'

  for i in range(97, 123):
    letter = chr(i)       
    k = s.count(letter)
    print('Number of occurrences of ' + letter + ' is ' + str(k))
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.26

Type up the above idea `my_count_problem.py`. Then, find another pangram and apply the program to that pangram. Submit your program with the pangram shown above (not the one you found).
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 5.27

This can be taken a step further. Instead of typing the pangram in the program itself (as was done above), ask the user to enter it as input. In `my_count_problem2.py`, read a string from the user and print the letter counts. When you test your program, use the pangram you found as input.

###### **5.28 Video**
{{< video ../../../media/units/unit0/module5/u0-mod5.29.mp4 aspect-ratio="21x9" >}}

Lastly, we'll point out a slightly more elegant way of iterating over the 26 letters:

```python
ascii_a = ord('a')
ascii_z = ord('z')
for i in range(ascii_a, ascii_z + 1):
    letter = chr(i)       
    # Now somehow use that to do the counting of occurences
```
:::{.callout-note}
- Instead of typing in the numbers 97 and 123 (which we'd have to remember), we're instead using the `ord` function itself to identify the limits of the loop.
- An even more (but harder to read) compact way is to write:
  ```python
  for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
      letter = chr(i)       
  ```
We'll understand this better once we see functions in more detail.
:::

Finally, we've written a program to solve an actual problem. Perhaps there's a market out there for pangram-checkers?

## 5.8 When things go wrong
In each of the exercises below, try to identify the error before typing it up and confirming. Then, fix the error in the code, using the specified program (`.py`) name.

### Exercise 5.30

```python
x = 'Hello'
y = 'World'
s = 'x' + ' ' + 'y'
print(s)
```
(This should print `Hello World`, with a space in between). Fix the error in `error1.py` and submit it.
