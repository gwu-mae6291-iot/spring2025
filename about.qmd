## Goal 
The goal of the course is to introduce the students to the building blocks of the IoT ecosystem with emphasis on Edge Computing. 

## Learning objectives
1. Hands-on knowledge of Raspberry Pi hardware with Python programming language 
2. Exposure to various sensors and actuators with hands-on exercises and in-class IoT projects
3. Exposure to IoT automation platforms such as ThingSpeak and IFTTT
4. Implement Raspberry Pi-based IoT projects 
5. Implement edge computing strategies with the Raspberry Pi
6. Gain industry 4.0 exposure via invited speakers and case studies
 
## Learning Outcomes
As a result of completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the IoT framework and implementation using the Raspberry Pi	.
2. Perform experiments aimed at collecting and analyzing data.
3. Design and write Python programs and work with IoT automation platforms.
4. Work on engineering-innovation group projects.

## Additional Learning Outcomes
